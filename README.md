## Breakout Strategy

### **What it is**
The **Breakout Strategy** focuses on entering a trade when the price moves **beyond a key support or resistance level** with strong volume.  
It captures the beginning of **new trends**.

### **Why in Playbook**
- One of the **simplest and most popular strategies**.  
- Helps traders **spot momentum** and join early.  
- Good for learning **risk management** (since false breakouts are common).  

### **How it works**
- **Entry Rule:** Buy when price closes above resistance, or sell when price closes below support.  
- **Exit Rule:** Use stop-loss just below/above the breakout zone; set profit target or use trailing stop.  
- **Risk Rule:** Avoid over-leveraging as breakouts can reverse.

## Moving Average (MA) Crossover

### **What it is**
The **MA Crossover Strategy** uses two moving averages (fast & slow).  
When the fast MA crosses above the slow MA → **Buy Signal**.  
When the fast MA crosses below the slow MA → **Sell Signal**.

### **Why in Playbook**
- Simple **trend-following strategy**.  
- Helps beginners understand **market trends** instead of guessing.  
- A stepping stone to more advanced algo trading.  

### **How it works**
- **Entry Rule:** Buy when 50-day MA crosses above 200-day MA (Golden Cross).  
- **Exit Rule:** Sell when 50-day MA crosses below 200-day MA (Death Cross).  
- **Risk Rule:** Avoid using only MAs; confirm with volume or RSI.

## Mean Reversion

### **What it is**
The **Mean Reversion Strategy** assumes that prices tend to return to their **average value** after extreme moves.  
It bets on **short-term reversals**.

### **Why in Playbook**
- Gives traders a **counter-trend perspective**.  
- Encourages learning about **indicators** (Bollinger Bands, RSI, z-scores).  
- Useful in **sideways markets** where trends are weak.  

### **How it works**
- **Entry Rule:** Buy when price drops significantly below average (oversold).  
- **Exit Rule:** Sell when price returns to mean or enters overbought zone.  
- **Risk Rule:** Avoid fighting strong trends; works best in range-bound markets.
