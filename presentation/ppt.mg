#  Presentation: Nubra Trade Playbook

## **1. Introduction**
- Nubra is building a next-gen platform for retail traders.  
- Problem: Manual traders struggle to transition to **algorithmic trading** due to complexity, lack of trust, and steep learning curves.  
- Goal: Design a feature ("Trade Playbook") that bridges **manual → semi-automated → automated trading**.

## **2. Problem Statement**
- **Manual traders’ pain points:**
  - Difficult to translate intuition into algo rules.
  - Lack of safe environments to practice without risking money.
  - Steep learning curve with existing algo platforms.

- **Industry gap:**  
  No platform currently combines **education, guided simulation, and automation** in one flow.
